 	  Mach mk6.1_free, originally from Dave Slattengren
 	  <slatteng@mtxinu.COM>.
	  
	* kernel/i386at/kd.c: Made kdreboot() call cpu_shutdown() if 
	  the attempt to reset the machine through the keyboard controller
	  dosen't work.

	* kernel/i386at/kd.c: Dosen't include <com.h> anymore, or set 
	  RCLINE.  This isn't needed with the serial console changes.
	
	* kernel/i386at/if_3c503.h: added 3com vendor ID numbers.

	* kernel/i386at/if_ns8390.c: Added code from Linux to check for

	  nhd and sd devices to 2^10 for slice numbering.

	* kernel/i386at/nhd.c: Modified to use the array of partitions
	  and the common partitioning code.  Disklabels are still there,
	  but are fairly meaningless to the kernel (except for the basic
	  geometry information from the BIOS).

	* kernel/i386at/disk.h: minor addition of BAD_BLK from the
	  old hdreg.h file (which is gone)

	* kernel/i386at/pchd.c: removed as obsolete

	* kernel/i386at/hdreg.h: removed as obsolete

	  got DPMI support working (Win 3.1, Win95, OS/2)
	  modulo a few minor incompatibilities;
	  VCPI and DOS support are fully functional (again);
	  VCPI and DPMI now support fastints.

Wed Jan 17 17:18:57 1996  Bart Robinson  <lomew@fast.cs.utah.edu>

	* Serial console working for real.

	* kernel/bogus/rc.h: removed RCBAUD and added RCADDR, prettied up.

	* boot/serial.S: added.  This is used by the boot adaptor part,
	  the rest of the kernel uses mach4/kernel/device/cons.[ch].  This
	  file was taken from FreeBSD who took it from Mach sometime.

	* kernel/pc/putchar.c: changed to use serial.S if <rc.h> says so.

	* boot/bsd/Makerules: serial.S needs kernel/bogus to be on the -I
	  list

	* boot/linux/Makerules: ditto

	* kernel/i386at/model_dep.c: changed to call cninit() rather than
	  kdinit().  Also if booted with -d will call cninit() before
	  Debugger().  It used to have kd_cnmaygetc call cninit (yuk!)

	* kernel/i386at/console_list.h: removed.  The console is handled
	  differently now.

	* kernel/i386at/conf.c: console entry in the device list is now
	  the `virtual' one "cn" instead of "kd"

	* kernel/i386at/cons_conf.c: added.  Defines the constab array
	  which tells us which console-like things to look for.

	* kernel/i386at/com.c: tweaked to export an interface that
	  mach4/kernel/device/cons.[ch] wants.  RCBAUD is in here now
	  rather than rc.h.

	* kernel/i386at/kd.c: ditto

Wed Jan 17 13:51:46 1996  Kevin Van Maren  <vanmaren.cs.utah.edu>

	* Unified the partition code for IDE & SCSI device drivers
	
	* kernel/i386at/pc_label.c: deleted

	* kernel/i386/hd.c: deleted (old 'ide' driver)

	* kernel/i386at/nhdreg.h: Removed the definition of PDLOCATION,
	  should be in <i386at/disk.h> not here!
	
	* kernel/i386at/nhd.c: Removed IDE specific PC partition code.
	  Changed to use the unified partition code.

Mon Oct 30 08:33:01 1995  Bryan Ford <baford@cs.utah.edu>

	* Integrated Steve's and Bart's changes from the UK02p16-work branch.

	* boot: updated booter/kernel interface to be (mostly) conformant
	  to MultiBoot-0.3 proposal.

	* boot/bsd/crt0.S: pass a boot loader value (Mach/NetBSD/FreeBSD)
	  as well as boothowto and bootdev.

	* boot/bsd/main.c: Fabricate a proper MultiBoot kernel command line
	  from the boothowto and bootdev values.

	* boot/bsd/main.c: Cleaned up symbol table loading, so it should
	  work with all a.out format variants.

	* boot/bsd/main.c: Provide the kernel info on the device we booted from.

	* mach4-i386/kernel/i386at/model_dep.c: MultiBoot-0.3 compliance.

	* mach4-i386/kernel/i386at/interrupt.S: mostly fix interrupt nesting
	  problem with Linux driver changes.

Mon Oct 16 14:49:01 1995  steve clawson  <sclawson@marker.cs.utah.edu>

	  the original Mach bootblocks, the old BSD (which NetBSD uses)
	  bootblocks and the new-style FreeBSD bootblocks.  

Fri Oct 13 16:59:10 1995  steve clawson  <sclawson@marker.cs.utah.edu>

	* boot/boot_info.c: Add code to add the symbol table into the 
	  occupied list that we hand to the kernel.

	* boot/bsd/crt0.S: Added in code to pass along the boothowto and
	  bootdev.  We should be able to tell between Mach, FreeBSD and
	  NetBSD bootblocks, but we don't tell anyone about it yet.

	* boot/bsd/main.c: Now tries to find the kernel symbol table and
	  put it into a `safe' place for the kernel to grab later.  It
	  also sets the bsd_boothowto and bsd_bootdev fields of the 
	  boot_info struct.

	* bootstrap/exec.c: Enabled code to load symbol tables.

	* kernel/i386/setroot.c: Changed code to work with BSD bootblocks
	  (and their major device numbering...sd == 4, instead of 3).

	* kernel/i386at/model_dep.c: Now sets kern_sym_start and
  	  kern_sym_size from boot_info, along with boothowto and
	  bootinfo from the bootblocks.

  	  image will build both the linux and bsd images (Mach and zMach),
 	  in the Object directory, the others will only build their their
 	  respective images.

	* kernel/bogus/hpp.h: Changed #define to be 1, so that the driver
	  is included by default.

	* kernel/i386at/autoconf.c: Changes for NE2000.
	  kernel/i386at/conf.c: Likewise.
	  kernel/i386at/if_ne.c: NE2000 driver.

Fri Nov 25 13:56:32 MST 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	Merged in diffs from UK02p6 to UK02p7:

	Sun Nov 20 11:56:51 MST 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Changed the ifdefs referring to '__liXnux__' back to '__linux__'
	  so that partition interpretation will once again default to
	  standard PC-style when compiled on a Linux machine.
	  If you're cross-compiling from Linux and want BSD partitioning
	  anyway, add '-U__linux__' to the DEFINES line in Makeconf.

	* Modified Alvin's compressed boot image mechanism slightly
	  so the Linux-derived files can be taken _completely_
	  unmodified from the Linux kernel source distribution.
	  Easier to keep up-to-date this way.  Also created a little
	  shell script to update these files automatically.

	* Separated out the 'mkbootimage' script and supporting stuff
	  into a separate 'boot/bsd' subdirectory, just like the
	  Linux boot image stuff was separated out.  Now the top-level
	  'boot' directory contains _only_ stuff related to
	  boot _modules_.

	* The top-level Makefile is no longer responsible for creating
	  the "default boot image" containing all available boot modules.
	  Instead, boot/bsd/Makefile now produces a default 32-bit boot
	  image ('boot.all'), and boot/linux/Makefile produces a
	  default 16-bit compressed Linux boot image ('zMach.all').

	* Cleaned up the console code a little bit.

	Mon Nov 14 22:50:57 -0500 1994  Alvin Starr <alvin@eyepoint.com>

	* Separated out the Linux boot image creation mechanisms
	  into a separate 'boot/linux' subdirectory, and changed
	  it to produce compressed Linux boot images.  The Linux
	  boot images produced are now _exactly_ like those
	  produced by Linux, in that they use all the same 16-bit
	  setup code and decompression code and everything.
	  This also means you can 'dd' one of these boot images
	  straight onto a floppy to create a Mach boot floppy.

	  To create compressed Linux boot images now, use the
	  new 'mkliloimage' script.  It works just like 'mkbootimage'.

	  The old 'mkbootimage' script is still there, but is greatly
	  simplified since it no longer needs to produce Linux-compatible
	  boot images at all.  One side-effect of this is that the
	  32-bit boot images produced by this script will be in the
	  "native" executable format of the build environment in use.
	  For example, if you build under NetBSD, the produced 32-bit
	  boot images will load fine from BSD boot blocks, but probably
	  not from Mach boot blocks, because the Mach boot blocks don't
	  know about BSD's newer a.out format.

	* Enabled SCSI drivers.

	* God kernel debugger working again.

	* Changed kd.c to handle tabs correctly.

	Fri Sep 30 21:38:31 1994  Patrick Doyle  (wpd@peanutbutter)

	* Makefile.in
	  (SORTED_SUBDIRS):
	    Added a macro to generated a "sorted" list of subdirectories
	    such that those listed in $(FIRST_SUBDIRS) are first.  Changed
	    the "all" and "install" rules to use this macro so we don't
	    have to descend into those subdirs twice.  (Idea was stolen
	    from glibc makefile).
	  (boot.all):
	    Added rule to generate "boot.all" in the top level object
	    directory and changed "all" to create this target.

Sat Oct 22 14:59:03 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Incorporated tons of minor changes and additions
	  produced by my Mach-based DOS extender project.
	  Mostly involved cleaning up and adding to libmach_sa.

Tue Oct 25 12:32:28 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Released UK02p6.

	* Moved exec header interpretation stuff from the bootstrap code
	  into libmach so the kernel could also use it when initializing
	  the bootstrap program itself.

Fri Sep 16 11:33:44 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Fixed a bug in locore.S that caused occasional
	  "null pv_list" panics from within pmap.c.

	* Fixed a bug in pmap.c: forgot to clear the kernel
	  page directory before initializing (only part of) it.

Fri Sep  9 10:45:26 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Added kernel/imps directory 
	  for Intel MultiProcessor Spec compliant PCs;
	  only enabled if user specifies --enable-mp.

	* boot image building scripts: exit when errors occur

	* boot/mkbmod.sh: changed -s to -no-strip to avoid confusion

Thu Sep  8 16:51:15 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* bootstrap/exec.c:
	  support NetBSD big-endian ZMAGIC executables

	* include/Makefile.in:
	  fixed installation directories

Tue Sep  6 08:49:39 1994  Patrick Doyle  (wpd@peanutbutter)

	* Makefile.in (install): Changed "install" rule so that it doesn't
	  gratuitously reinstall boot.all.

Mon Sep  5 12:11:45 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Full cross compilation support

	* Changed default Mach boot image filename
	  from `machboot' to just `boot'.

	* Automatically create a `boot.all' upon installation
	  containing all boot modules.

Sat Sep  3 07:13:44 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Bugfix: boot code didn't clear NT flag properly,
	  and the VTech Platinum BIOS was leaving it set.

	* Added get_esp() and get_eflags() in proc_reg.h.

	* Added debug_trace facility.

	* bootstrap/exec.c: got rid of #ifdef __linux__'s;
	  instead, support both at once and detect at runtime.

	* include/mach/machine/disk.h,
	  kernel/i386/pc_hd_label.c:
	  hacked #ifdef __linux__'s to #ifdef __liXnux__
	  to get back to BSD-style partition table interpretation.

Fri Aug 26 09:52:35 1994  Jeff Law  (law@fast.cs.utah.edu)

	* configure: Add "-print" argument to find so that it works with
	non-GNU finds. 

Mon Aug 1 18:15:00 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Got most of the migrating threads changes merged in

Mon Aug  1 14:45:52 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Integrated Louis-D. Dubeau's pchd (PC hard drive) patches.


Wed Jul 20 14:00:45 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* include/Makefile: top-level header files weren't getting installed.

	* Moved kernel i386/eflags.h to include/mach/machine/eflags.h,
	  so outsiders such as LITES can use it if they want to.

	* Released UK02


Fri Jul 15 11:46:19 MDT 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* Kernel address space and physical memory
	  is now mapped at virtual address 0 instead of 0xC0000000.
	  (It's still up high in linear memory,
	  but the kernel segment registers are used to shift addresses.)

	* All copyin/copyout code now uses segment registers
	  to access user space, like Linux does.

	* Separated the console stuff out of kd.c and into (new) console.c.
	  No longer initialize the console at the very beginning in i386_init;
	  instead do it with the rest of the devices, in machine_startup.

	* console.c: Created a kludgy little "immediate console" for kernel debugging
	  which spews things onto a CGA/EGA/VGA display
	  without requiring _any_ initialization first.
	  It gets disabled automatically when the real console is initialized.

	* include/mach/boot_info.h: deleted, because it was only for the old
	  `makeboot'-based server bootstrap mechanism.
	  Superseded by the new include/mach/boot.h.

	* Lots of other minor changes.
