Quick fixes:

* Make the build environment work when object and source directories 
  are the same, or else make configure print an error message if
  the user tries to put them in the same place.


Minor modifications:

* Document the new boot image stuff - scripts, utilities, etc.

* Get partition table interpretation to work
  for both Linux and DOS partition

* Generate public .h files from .defs files
  in the include/ object directory instead of libmach/.

* Rename HOST to BUILD and TARGET to HOST throughout the build environment.
  While I'm at it, rename GSRCDIR to GENTREE, MSRCDIR to I386TREE
  or PATREE, and DSRCDIR to DOSTREE.  Or something like that.

* All the stuff in Michael Bushnell's tasks file for the Hurd.


Major modifications:

* Support BIOS calls from Mach.  Linux needs this too.  Partly done already.

* Integrate migrating threads and the presentation IPC system.

* Make a new boot loader that's backward-compatibile with LILO
  and the Mach/BSD boot loaders, but fixes some of their more glaring problems.


Grandiose dreams:

* Support device drivers from other operating systems,
  such as Linux, NetWare (ODE/NPA), Windows, NT, SCO, etc.
