	* user.c (WriteMsgCheckReceive): If the reply-port isn't
	user-supplied and there was a message transmission error, then

	* user.c (WriteMsgCheckIdentity): Dealloc reply port if a
 	mismatched reply comes in to avoid cascaded errors.  From 
	Michael I Bushnell (mib@gnu.ai.mit.edu).

Fri Nov 25 13:56:32 MST 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	Merged in diffs from UK02p6 to UK02p7:

	* MIG now compiles under BSD without 'vm_???_t' types
	  conflicting between host (BSD) and target (Mach)
	  header files.  Basically, the MIG source files compiled
	  to run on the host machine no longer include mach/message.h;
	  instead they get the needed defines through cpu.h
	  which is built by compiling cpu.sym for the target machine.

Mon Aug 29 18:31:21 1994  Bryan Ford  (baford@cs.utah.edu)

	* got rid of /usr/bin pathname in call to basename:
	basename isn't always in /usr/bin.

	* user.c (WriteMsgCheckReceive): Deallocate the reply port also if
	we get one of the send errors that can cause the message to be
	partially sent and then destroyed; otherwise we might later get a
	spurious send-once notification.
