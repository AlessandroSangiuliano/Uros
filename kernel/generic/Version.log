[UK22]
        First release containing expanded set of Linux drivers
        (including SCSI, block and network; ISA, EISA, VLB and PCI).
        Conforms to MultiBoot-0.5.  Now works on systems with small
        memories again.

[UK02p21]
	First _public_ release containing Shantanu's Linux drivers.
	The only significant differences from UK02p20 are that
	Shantanu provided a proper fix for the interrupt disable bug,
	and upgraded the Linux drivers to more recent versions.

[UK02p20]
	After fixing interrupt problems, this is the
	first release containing Shantanu's linux drivers
	that actually works for us.
	Also, in this release the kernel has been mostly
	updated to conform to MultiBoot-0.3.
	This is an internal release for Shantanu.

[UK02p19]
	The merged IPC code was causing problems (e.g. incompatibilities
	with UX due to removed features), so we rolled most of
	the IPC changes back out.  We left a few very trivial
	changes in, such as some of the ANSIfied function prototypes.

[UK02p18]
	Merged in some of the generic IPC code changes from OSF's latest
	kernel (mk6.1 free).

[UK02p17]
	First release containing Shantanu's Linux drivers.
	They don't work yet for us, however.
	This is a private release for Shantanu Goel to debug
	and integrate newer versions of his drivers into.

[UK02p16-work]
	This was a temporary development branch based on
	the last working release (UK02p16) before we integrated
	Shantanu's device drivers which didn't work for us
	at the time.  Many of the changes between UK02p19
	and UK02p20 were from this branch.

[UK02p16]
	Private release for Randy Dukes of Novell.

[UK02p15]
	Added ELF support, so the kernel can be compiled completely
	using ELF .o's and executables.  '--enable-elf' must be
	specified on the command line for this to work.

[UK02p13]
	First release will _all_ of the MK83->MK83a changes merged in
	(the i386-specific changes didn't make it before).

[UK02p12]
	Lots of boot-related hacking.
	Also, integrated low-level mode switching code developed
	as part of MOSS, the DOS extender based on Mach sources.

[UK02p9]
	Integrated Shantanu Goel's new floppy and hard drive
	device drivers for mach.  These are written from scratch,
	and are not under the GPL.  Also integrated his ports of
	some Linux Ethernet drivers, which _are_ GPL'd; placed
	these in a separate kernel/i386at/gpl subdirectory so
	they can easily be separated out.  Finally, Steve Clawson
	ported the Linux HPLAN+ driver, and added it to the
	gpl directory as well.

[UK02p8]
	Added support for 4.4 BSD fastlinks to the filesystem
	interpretation code in the server bootstrap program.
	Lots of other minor changes and fixes, mostly boot-related.
