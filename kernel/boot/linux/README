Most of the files in this directory are derived from Linux code, and are
therefore copyrighted under the GNU General Public License (GPL) unlike the
rest of Mach.  See the file COPYING for distribution details.

In short, any Mach boot images built with the 'mklinuximage' script will
contain code from this directory, and therefore the ENTIRE resulting Mach
boot image will fall under the GPL.  Other types of boot images (such as
the BSD-style boot images generated by the 'mkbsdimage' script) do not
contain GPL code and therefore will not cause the resulting boot image to
fall under the GPL unless other GPL is used elsewhere.

Some of the files in this directory are taken verbatim from the Linux
kernel source distribution.  These files are listed in the
Update-from-Linux shell script, and should be kept in sync with and
unmodified from the standard Linux distribution if at all possible.  If any
modifications are needed, maybe they could be integrated into the standard
Linux distribution instead of making the Mach versions diverge.  In any
case be sure and keep the Update-from-Linux script up-to-date.
