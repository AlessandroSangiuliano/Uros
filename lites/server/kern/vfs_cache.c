/*
 * Name caching works as follows:
 *
 * Names found by directory scans are retained in a cache
 * for future reference.  It is managed LRU, so frequently
 * used names will hang around.  Cache is indexed by hash value
 * obtained from (vp, name) where vp refers to the directory
 * containing name.
 *
 * For simplicity (and economy of storage), names longer than
 * a maximum length of NCHNAMLEN are not cached; they occur
 * infrequently in any case, and are almost never of interest.
 *
 * Upon reaching the last segment of a path, if the reference
 * is for DELETE, or NOCACHE is set (rewrite), and the
 * name is located in the cache, it will be dropped.

 * Lookup is called with ni_dvp pointing to the directory to search,
 * ni_ptr pointing to the name of the entry being sought, ni_namelen
 * tells the length of the name, and ni_hash contains a hash of
 * the name. If the lookup succeeds, the vnode is returned in ni_vp
 * and a status of -1 is returned. If the lookup determines that
 * the name does not exist (negative cacheing), a status of ENOENT
 * is returned. If the lookup fails, a status of zero is returned.
