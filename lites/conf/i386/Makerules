# SRCDIR must be set to the directory of the i386 source tree.
# SECTIONS must be set to any optional sections to activate.
# (The current directory is assumed to be the object directory.)


# Get rid.

# Required compiler/assembler flags.
# Note that we don't have to bother with HOST_anything
# for assembly language sources:
# the host probably can't execute i386 assembly language anyway.
TARGET_ASFLAGS	+= -DASSEMBLER -D__LANGUAGE_ASSEMBLY


# The generic source tree doesn't know about assembly language,
# so we work it out here.
# The SRCDIRS variable isn't complete yet
# (it doesn't have the generic directories in it),
# but that's no problem because we know there's no assembly language
# in the generic directories anyway.
