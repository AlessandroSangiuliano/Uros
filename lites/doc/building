I was thinking of incrementing the minor version number when this
happens. However, if I do snapshots often enough I might forget to do
that. Like the previous one was just a tar of my work tree as I
kind of indicated in the ftp area.

Here are some:
o Install gcc and binutils for the relevant target architectures.
  Gcc must be 2.5.8 or newer.
o Create an object directory
o cd there
o run configure
o gmake
o gmake install

Configure takes a few options
--build=BBB		specifies the machine you are building on.

--host=TTT		specifies the target (this is confusing. It ought to
			be --target).

--prefix=III		specifies the install area.

--srcdir=SSS		specifies where the source is.

--with-release=RRR	specifies a Mach release tree (sup one from
			CMU for example). Libraries and includes not
			found in the prefix directory are searched
			from here.

--enable-debug		adds +DEBUG to the configuration

--enable-profiling	adds -DGPROF and -pg and uses libmach_sa_p.a etc.

--with-config=CCC	sets the server configuration. See
			conf/MASTER.h and other MASTER files. The default is
			STD+WS.

Here is a sample shell script I use for running configure:
----------------- begin runconfigure.sh -----------------------
#!/bin/sh -x

cd /obj/lites
mkdir obj
cd obj

# Example: cross compile pmax -> i386

/p/mach/mach3/work/src/lites/configure -v --host=i386-mach --build=mips-dec-mach --prefix=/obj/lites/inst --srcdir=/p/mach/mach3/work/src/lites --enable-debug --with-release=/p/mach/mach3/work/export/pmax_mach_X_i386_lite $*

#--enable-profiling
----------------- end runconfigure.sh -----------------------


If you are compiling Mach4 then you should first complie and install
it with the same install directory.  If you are using Mach3 then you
need to create a release tree with the kernel etc. In theory you could
pick up a standard MK83a release and build with that.

Mach4 moved some includes etc. so Lites might not compile without some
minor tweaking with it at the moment.  Perhaps some ifdefs or similar
could take care of the differences so we could use both.

It seems we are out of sync again.  If I make snapshots all the time
you will get versions that might not compile or work or whatever. If I
make them too seldom (every other day or so) you will end up with out
of sync code. But don't worry, I will have to do some other work for a
while soon so there will be a slowdown.

Let's do it this way: whenever I make a reasonably working snapshot
(compiles, boots), I'll send an announcement to the list. Intermediate
versions will just appear and you are on your own (like the previous
one).
