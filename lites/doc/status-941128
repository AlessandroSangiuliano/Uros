Subject: Snapshot 941128 and some plans
Date: Tue, 29 Nov 1994 01:37:25 +0200

Another pre-release snapshot is available from Leia.

New this weekend:
* Memory object caches and buffer caches are kept consistent.
* Sync cleans memory objects.  This time the speed is ok.
* Lites boots on mips with Ultrix binaries.  The port is still
  incomplete though.
* More warning options are added and zillions of warnings are
  eliminated.
* More type cleanup.

The diffs from November 16 are rather large (290k unidiff).  This is
mostly due to 64 bit fixes and other fixes as well as eliminating
warnings.  A few files have changed a lot for other reasons.

Unfortunately large diffs now and later will make life hard for other
developers but that can't be helped except by quick integration.

I have not fixed warnings in files that I haven't otherwise changed
much.  This is to make integration of FreeBSD and NetBSD fixes easier.
If someone has time to look at merging file system and other changes
that'd be most useful.  I won't get to that in 2-4 months I think.

Instead I plan to fix the following bugs:
- mapped file sizes get rounded up on pageout. Should believe ftrunc.
- perhaps fix the mips port a bit more.
- fix copyrights etc. administrative stuff.
- integrate all the great code you send me. (or most of it anyway).
- make a public release soon (this could be called version 0.X).

	more sometimes 1995.



Other bugs that are known but not being worked on:

- umount doesn't seem to do enough flushing
  (if you first run fsck and then do mount -u there will still be junk
  in the caches).
- gdb stack traces from the emulator to user space doesn't work on the
  MIPS.  I can't see what's wrong in the debug info I wrote in the
  assembly code or what is going wrong and I'm ready to give up on
  this.
- NFS between Lites and most our servers doesn't work.  It works with
  some old sun4s though.  NetBSD doesn't work any better in this
  respect.  I already picked up some fixes in the early stages of
  Lites and tested it with a sparc box then.
- Support for Linux/FreeBSD/NetBSD X servers is missing.

Here is an old but still valid todo list:

- A library for code common to the server and emulator and perhaps later
  other programs.
      At least exec_file.c, bcopy etc., ntoh, and so on could be moved
      there.
      Requires changes to the build system.

- Figure out how to avoid deadlocking risks arising from printf
  calling functions taking locks.  Printf is called in a large variety
  of places where all kinds of locks may be held.  Printing to ttys,
  selwakeup, etc. in this situation creates a big potential for
  deadlock.

	I added a comment next to printf noting this problem.

- Fix and test build environment so that building on Linux and BSD
  really works.

- Enhance the sysv support to make it real.

- 64 bit cleanup.	[PARTIALLY DONE]

- Add support for Linux and or BSD X servers.  This is mostly related
  to virtual consoles I think.

- Write /sbin/cored -- the core dumping daemon.

- Experiment with +ether_as_syscall and get it to work enough to make
  it default.
	This is about running protocol stacks on the network input
	thread instead of going through netisrs.  It is important for
	simplifying splx and the whole spl mechanism.  Also network
	latency ought to decrease.

	The first select in inetd didn't wake up last time I tried.
	After this I've fixed some bug related to select but there are
	still some uncertainty related to sockets so this might be a
	difficult thing to debug.

- Fix /proc and other Lite stuff that is in conf/MASTER.h listed in
  the UNTESTED, ALMOST, and NOTYET categories.
