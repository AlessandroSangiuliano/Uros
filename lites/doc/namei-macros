Subject: Namei macros added
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 1994 03:33:19 +0200

I added the following namei expansions together with Juki <jtv@hut.fi>

@sys	expands to i386_lites, mips_lites, etc. per system basis
@cpu	expands to i386, mips, ns532, ...
@host	expands to the host name.
@bin	expands like @sys but per binary basis depending on what kind
	of a binary is being executed.  The strings are
	i386_linux, i386_freebsd, i386_netnsd, i386_ux, mips_ultrix,
	etc.  (Comments about the name choices are welcome: see
	exec_file.h)

The macros are expanded by namei.  A path component must be the
literal string (the macro must occupy an entire path component).
Symlinks may contain namei macros.

The idea is to make it easier to have several sets of binaries on the
same machine and to make switching between OSs easier.  For example
FreeBSD and NetBSD use the same names and paths for shared libraries.
However, they are not compatible with each other.  @bin may be used to
distinguish (make a symlink containing @bin).

Another otherwise hard case is device numbers.  Now you may have two
/dev directories and choose on runtime.  Create /@sys in Linux, and
move dev there.  ln -s /@sys/dev /dev.  Create /i386_lites/dev and
create the suitable devices there.  Now both Lites and Linux will work
(in this respect).

@host and @cpu might be nice sometimes so they got added too.  But
more than that I think is too much so now @uid, @pid, @date, or
was added.

I didn't make it default yet. Build with +atsys for now.  That can be
done from configure by giving the option --with-config=STD+WS+atsys


A diff and new snapshot are available in the usual place.
