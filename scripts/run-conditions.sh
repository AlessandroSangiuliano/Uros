# ── Why this is one file and not two ──────────────────────────────────
#
# 🔑 EACH HARNESS RECORDED THE HALF THE OTHER OMITTED, which is how #516 was
# hiding in plain sight on both targets at once:
#
#   run-qemu.sh (i386)  samples the governor, the clock and the power source
#                       (#460) — and never says which accelerator it used on
#                       its default path, which is KVM.
#   run-x86_64.sh       says the accelerator, the board and the memory (#477)
#                       — and never samples the clock at all.
#
# So a comparison across the two targets could not be made honestly from their
# own output, and neither could a comparison between two runs of the same one.
# The rule this serves wants FOUR things to coincide before two numbers may be
# compared: the machine, the accelerator, the clock condition — sampled, not
# assumed from the governor's name — and how the run was driven.  A fifth is
# what else was running.  One of them missing is enough.
#
# ── Why it is written to the LOG and not only to the screen ───────────
#
# 🔴 Both scripts already printed most of this, to stdout, where it is gone the
# moment the terminal scrolls.  Grepping what this project keeps:
#
#	$ grep -ac accelerator ~/uros-tests/515-x86_64-kvm.log   ->  0
#	$ grep -ac accelerator <the same run's stdout>           ->  1
#
# The grep can match; the logs simply never carried it.  So every saved x86-64
# log was, in this issue's own words, a verdict about an unknown machine — and
# a re-judge of an old log could not recover what made it.
#
# ── Why the clock is sampled TWICE ────────────────────────────────────
#
# 🔥 Because it moves, and the movement is deterministic rather than random: a
# build heats the package, so the first boots after one run at a lower clock
# than the later ones.  #560 lost a whole campaign to exactly that — arm A ran
# at 3000 MHz and arm B at 3993, and the difference read as the change under
# test.  A run that changed clock mid-flight is a run nobody may compare, and
# now it says so instead of being found out afterwards.

# One line: the host's half of the four axes.  The FREQUENCY and not only the
# governor's name — on this laptop `performance' on battery still reported
# 3.99 GHz while `powersave' gave 1.40, so the name alone would have compared
# runs 2.85x apart without noticing (#460).
#
# 🔴 AND THE CEILING, not only where the clock happens to be (#544).  An idle
# machine under `powersave' with scaling_max_freq at 3.0 GHz reports the same
# 1397 MHz as one PINNED at 1.4, and the two are different experiments: the
# first climbs to 3.0 the moment the run loads it, the second cannot.  Without
# the cap, "measured at low clock" and "measured at a clock that was low when I
# looked" print the same line -- which is the same defect this issue is about,
# one layer down: two states, one label.

	# 🔴 THE CEILING IS NOT THE CLOCK, and the governor decides which.
	#
	# With `acpi-cpufreq' the `powersave' governor is STATIC: it pins the core
	# to scaling_min_freq and the ceiling above it means nothing.  Raising
	# scaling_max_freq from 1400 to 3000 while leaving that governor in place
	# changes the recorded ceiling and not one megahertz of the machine.
	#
	# That cost a campaign: eleven runs were taken as the "high clock" arm with
	#
	#     governor=powersave cpu=1397MHz cap=3000MHz
	#
	# and every fact needed to notice was on that line.  The block reported and
	# did not conclude, so the ceiling got read and the governor did not.  A
	# passing run took 454-463s in both arms -- identical, which is what
	# settled it, because the same work at twice the clock is not the same
	# number of seconds.
	#
	# ⚠️ Driver-dependent on purpose: under `intel_pstate' the very same name
	# means a DYNAMIC governor that does ramp.  Encoded rather than assumed,
	# because being quietly wrong here is what this line exists to stop.
	#
	# ⚠️ AND BOOST GOES OVER THE POLICY CEILING.  Measured here, with
	# scaling_max_freq at 3000000 and boost enabled, the cores ran at
	# 3918-3992 MHz -- above the ceiling that had just been set.  So the
	# honest number with boost on is cpuinfo_max_freq (4000 MHz on this
	# machine), and reporting the policy ceiling would understate the
	# machine by a gigahertz.  Said from the measurement rather than from
	# what the driver is supposed to do.
